## INTRODUCTION
This is a simple daily planner that allows the user to add important events for each hour of the work day to more efficiently manage time. 

When the daily planner is opened, the current date and time are displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, time blocks for standard business hours are present. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.

When the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event and click the save button. This will save the event text in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved data persists.

## TECHNOLOGIES
This project features HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Font Awesome, Google Fonts, and Moment.js.

## SOURCES
Original challenge, CSS and HTML source code presented by Trilogy Education Services.
